# Pixel Worlds Server
The first ever open-sourced Pixel Worlds Server, made in C# 6.0, provides the basic features of the game in well-structured, organized, reliable, and fast code.

## What does not work (found out so far)
 - Shop
 - Netherworld

## Dependencies
The server uses [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) as its database, dependency injection code design, [log4net](https://logging.apache.org/log4net/) as its logging, and [7zip](https://github.com/adoconnection/SevenZipExtractor) for [lzma](https://7-zip.org/sdk.html) compression.

## Building The Project (Docker)
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/zKevz/Pixel-Worlds-Server
$ docker build -t pixel-worlds-server -f Dockerfile .
$ docker run pixel-worlds-server
```

## Building The Project (Manual)
1. Make sure to have [.NET 6.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/) installed
2. Compile the project
3. If you are compiling from the command line, you need to copy the `PixelWorldsServerPixelWorldsServer.Server\Data` directory into the executable directory. If you are using an IDE such as Visual Studio, those files will be automatically copied to the executable directory, so you don't need to do it manually.
